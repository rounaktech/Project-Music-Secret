Symphony is a music rhythm game where you must play back tunes that you hear. At the start of each level, you will be played a short tune. You must then go to the piano and try to play back the tune as accurately as possible. You can see the notes you have played on top of the piano, and you can rewrite your answer by pressing the clear button. Once you are confident with your answer, press the buzzer. If your answer is correct, you will proceed to the next level. If your rhythm/answer is incorrect, you will have to restart the level, because THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENNED.

As you progress through the game, the tunes will become more and more difficult to play. You will need to use your memory and your musical skills to succeed. Symphony is a challenging but rewarding game that is perfect for music lovers of all ages.
